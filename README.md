Hi, I'm 1nfocalypse.
I'm a recent graduate, with a BS in Computer Science. I'm primarily interested in algorithm development, applied mathematics, security, and systems. I'm also a bit of a cyberpunk nerd.
Currently working on multiple projects, including:
- Kuznyechik, Magma, ShangMi 4, AES, RSA, ElGamal, ECDLP implementations
- The Traffic Throughput Optimization Project (almost done)
- Numerical Analysis Writeup
- Cryptography Writeup Problems/Solutions
- P2P E2E messaging client utilizing crypto that I've rolled
- Reason Preexploitation Framework
- Coding Theory Writeup + Examples?
- [Cutter.re](https://cutter.re/) module
- EnkiNum Numerical Analysis Library
- Automated network priority resolution standard
- Research on Fractionated Cavity Loaders
- Research and (hopefully) implementation of Shpilrain's Algorithm, based on the undecidability of problems regarding the free word group in Combinatorial Group Theory
- Research on solutions to decentralized, anonymous, encrypted group messaging.
- Research on compression efficiency, particularly with regards to finding optimality for expected compression in number of symbols permitted via decompositional preprocessing


Currently funemployed, but my website with professional contact information will be up soon if you are interested in reaching out.
