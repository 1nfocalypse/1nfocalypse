Hi, I'm 1nfocalypse.
I'm a recent graduate, with a BS in Computer Science. I'm primarily interested in algorithm development, applied mathematics, security, and systems. I'm also a bit of a cyberpunk nerd.
Currently working on multiple projects, including:
- The Traffic Throughput Optimization Project (almost done)
- RSA, ElGamal, ECDLP implementations
- Numerical Analysis Writeup
- Cryptography Writeup Problems/Solutions
- P2P messaging client using ECDLP
- Reason Preexploitation Framework
- Coding Theory Writeup + Exampes?
- [Cutter.re](https://cutter.re/) module
- EnkiNum Numerical Analysis Library
- Automated network priority resolution standard
- Research on Fractionated Cavity Loaders
- Implementation of Plausibly deniable XOR encryption and a toy illustrating a plausibly deniable asymmetric scheme
- Research and (hopefully) implementation of Shpilrain's Algorithm, based on the undecidability of problems regarding the free word group in Combinatorial Group Theory
- Research on solutions to decentralized, anonymous, encrypted group messaging.
- Research on compression efficiency, particularly with regards to finding optimality for expected compression in number of symbols permitted via decompositional preprocessing


Currently funemployed, but my website with professional contact information will be up soon if you are interested in reaching out.
