Hi, I'm 1nfocalypse.
I'm a CS and Applied Mathematics student that likes to mess around with almost anything related to computers, along with a bit of a cyberpunk nerd.
Currently working on multiple projects, including:
- Toy ElGamal
- Toy RSA
- ElGamal with Elliptic Curves
- Cryptography Writeup
- System for utilizing ElGamal implementation to send secure P2P messages
- Reason Preexploitation Framework
- Coding Theory Examples

- [Cutter.re](https://cutter.re/) module
- EnkiNum Numerical Analysis Library
- Numerical Analysis Writeup

I'm back in school. I'm dead to the world until early May. Send caffeine and pizza pls.
I'm still somewhat hard to get ahold of, but I'll fix that soon! Thanks for checking out my account.
