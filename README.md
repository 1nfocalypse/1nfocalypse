Hi, I'm 1nfocalypse.
I'm a CS student with an interest in applied mathematics that likes to mess around with almost anything related to computers, along with a bit of a cyberpunk nerd.
Currently working on multiple projects, including:
- The Traffic Throughput Optimization Project
- RSA, ElGamal, ECDLP implementations
- Numerical Analysis Writeup
- Cryptography Writeup Problems/Solutions
- P2P messaging client using ECDLP
- Reason Preexploitation Framework
- Coding Theory Writeup + Exampes?
- [Cutter.re](https://cutter.re/) module
- EnkiNum Numerical Analysis Library
- Automated network priority resolution standard
- Research on Fractionated Cavity Loaders
- Research on Plausible Deniability XOR Crypters
- Research and (hopefully) implementation of Shpilrain's Algorithm, based on the undecidability of problems in Combinatorial Group Theory
- Research on solutions to decentralized, anonymous, encrypted group messaging.
- Research on compression efficiency, particularly with regards to finding optimality for expected compression in number of symbols permitted 

I'm back in school. I'm dead to the world until early May. Send caffeine and pizza pls.
I'm still somewhat hard to get ahold of, but I'll fix that soon! Thanks for checking out my account.
