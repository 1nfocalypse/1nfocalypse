Hi, I'm 1nfocalypse.
I'm a recent graduate, with a BS in Computer Science. I'm primarily interested in algorithm development, applied mathematics, security, and systems. I'm also a bit of a cyberpunk nerd.

I currently mostly work with numerical and (to use Knuth's verbiage) seminumerical algorithms. I also particularly enjoy cryptography, both theory and practice. I'm currently working primarily with GCC's libstdc++-v3,
in which I contributed Philox Engine for C++26 and am currently working on supporting the linalg header. I also maintain an entirely-too-large list of personal projects that I'm either currently working on, have 
started, or intend on working on, which can be found below. If you're interested in contacting me, I can be found at 1nfocalypse(at)protonmail(dot)com. I may miss your email in the sea of GCC mailing list stuff - if I don't respond,
please feel free to bump it up in my inbox again.


Current Projects:
- libstdc++-v3 Philox Engine (final review eggs dee)
- Cryptanalysis of the Philox PRNG
- libstdc++-v3 linalg header
- Development of a dual-hardness Elliptic Curve based CSPRNG algorithm, reliant on the ECDLP, Elligator 2, and bit truncation.
- ShangMi cryptologic suite implementation
- Hacker's Fright (A writeup on the book "Hacker's Delight")
- Serge Lang's Algebraic Number Theory (group read)
- Numerical Analysis Writeup
- AES, RSA, ElGamal implementations
- SHA256 and Keccak implementations
- P2P E2E messaging client utilizing crypto that I've rolled
- Coding Theory Writeup + Examples
- Automated network priority resolution standard for CANs based on error-correcting codes
- Research on Fractionated Cavity Loaders utilizing Plausibly Deniable Encryption
- Research and (hopefully) implementation of Shpilrain's Algorithm, based on the undecidability of problems regarding the free word group in Combinatorial Group Theory
- Research on solutions to decentralized, anonymous, encrypted group messaging.
- Research on compression efficiency, particularly with regards to finding optimality for expected compression in number of symbols permitted via decompositional preprocessing
- Library for wrapping C++ sockets to provide a better interface
